## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

- Good practice with mobile navigation.

### Continued development

- Grey out background on mobile when nav is open. I wasn't able to get this working right, I think because of how the main image is positioned.
- I think I would have put padding inside header and main (as opposed to body), and had these two be 100% width. I'm still figuring out the best way to approach this since most of these challenges up to this point have only been simple card layouts. 
- bug: if mobile nav is left open and browser is resized to desktop breakpoint, the drop down items won't be positioned in the correct place.

### Useful resources
